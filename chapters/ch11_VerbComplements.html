<h1 id="verb-complements">Verb complements</h1>
<p>A verb complement is a verb that serves as an object to another verb,
to a preposition or adjective. - I enjoy swimming - I don’t go hiking -
I promise to call</p>
<p>The verb complement is not part of a conjugation.</p>
<p>Verb complements can appear in either infinitive or gerund (-ing)
form. RULE: The verb complement is not part of the conjugated verb. For
this reason, if the verb is conjugated in the past tense, the verb
complement remains in the infinitive or gerund. Example: Say: “He wanted
to go”, not “He wanted to went”. Say “She decided to leave”, not “She
decided to left” When to use gerund (-ing) • as a complement to certain
verbs (see point 11.2 below) • after prepositions (incl. phrasal verbs
like give up) = give up smoking; relax after eating; instead of walking
• as the subject of a sentence = Eating out is quite cheap here. /
Surfing is dangerous. When to use to + infinitive • as a complement to
certain verbs (see point 11.3 below) • after adjectives = My flat is
easy to find. • to express reason or purpose = I’m saving money to buy a
car. When to use infinitive (without to) • as a complement to the verbs
make, let, and help: o Please let me go. o She makes me laugh. o Help me
find the solution!</p>

<h2 id="giving-orders-and-instructions">Giving orders and
instructions</h2>
<p>When giving instructions or making requests, an indirect object
(who?) can be placed between a verb and a verb complement. Consider the
following examples: She ordered me to do it. I want you to stay. I told
him to get out. I asked her to write more often I begged him not to
forget.</p>
<h2 id="two-important-expressions">Two important expressions</h2>
<p>• Use -ing with the frequently used expression “I look forward to…”:
I look forward to meeting you! • Use -ing with the frequently used
expression “be used to…” or “get used to…”: I am used to getting up
early; I got used to wearing a tie every day. Not *I’m used to get up
early.</p>
