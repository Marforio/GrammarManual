<p>Auxiliary verbs are essential components of sentence construction. As
we saw in chapters 3 and 4, auxiliaries coordinate the subject of the
sentence with the action (the verb) in the predicate.</p>
<p>This chapter focuses on other uses of auxiliary verbs in English
communication. When repeated at the end of the sentence, auxiliary verbs
serve as kind of abbreviation or quick reference to the entire
conjugated verb, enabling a variety of expressive actions such as asking
for confirmation, showing interest or doubt, and agreeing.</p>
<p>Using the auxiliary verb in these ways is considered an advanced
English language skill, not because of any inherent complexity, but
because it shows that the speaker is capable of nuanced and interactive
communication.</p>
<h2 id="polite-short-answers">Polite short answers</h2>
<p>Instead of answering with a bare <em>yes</em> or <em>no</em>, it is
more polite to repeat the auxiliary verb corresponding to the tense in
the question:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>- Are you happy? - Yes, I am.</em></p>
<p><em>- WIll you marry me? - No, I won’t.</em></p>
<p><em>- Do you like it? - Yes, I do.</em></p>
</div>
<h2 id="avoid-repeating-information">Avoid repeating information</h2>
<p>Repeating the auxiliary verb is a clear enough reference to the
conjugated verb, making it unnecessary to restate the entire
conjugation:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>I like dogs but my husband doesn’t.</em></p>
<p><em>My wife will not be able to attend, but I will.</em></p>
<p><em>John can speak French fluently and his daughter can too.</em></p>
</div>
<h2 id="showing-interest-echo-questions">Showing interest (echo
questions)</h2>
<p>To show an interest in what your interlocutor is saying, we form a
short question using the auxiliary verb from the interlocutor’s sentence
and a subject pronoun.</p>
<div class="compactenum">
<p><em>I love football.</em></p>
<p><em>Do you? Who’s your favorite team?</em></p>
</div>
<div class="compactenum">
<p><em>I spent 2 years in the Amazon rainforst.</em></p>
<p><em>Did you? Wow, it must have been special.</em></p>
</div>
<p><em>Do you?</em> and <em>Did you?</em> are examples of <span
class="smallcaps">echo questions</span> that show an interest in the
interlocutor’s statement.</p>
<p>Echo questions can also be used to express skepticisim or doubt.</p>
<div class="compactenum">
<p><em>We should buy a puppy for the kids.</em></p>
<p><em>Should we, really? Who’s going to take it out on walks?</em></p>
</div>
<h2 id="agreeing-with-so-and-neither">Agreeing (with “so” and
“neither”)</h2>
<p>You can agree with your interlocutor by saying <em>me too</em> (for
positive statements) or <em>me neither</em> (if you agree on a negative
statement). You can also do this by using <span class="smallcaps">so +
auxiliary + pronoun</span> or <span class="smallcaps">neither +
auxiliary + pronoun</span>.</p>
<div class="compactenum">
<p><em>I like Mexican food.</em></p>
<p><em>So do I.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="compactenum">
<p><em>I can’t swim.</em></p>
<p><em>Neither can I! We’re soulmates.</em></p>
</div>
<h2 id="tag-questions">Tag questions</h2>
<p>Tag questions are similar to echo questions, the only difference
being that the ’sign’ of the conjugation changes. Positive or
declarative conjugations are changed to negatives, and negatives are
changed to positives.</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>We’ve been here before, haven’t we?</em></p>
<p><em>You broke it, didn’t you?</em></p>
<p><em>Oh dear. We’re lost, aren’t we?</em></p>
</div>
<p>The effect of changing the sign in this way is to express a slight
doubt that invites confirmation, much like the French tag questions
<em>n’est-ce pas?</em> or <em>ou bien?</em>, or the German
<em>oder?</em>. Using them makes your interlocutor feel involved in the
conversation.</p>
<p>Tag questions are often rhetorical, however, which means that an
actual answer is not expected: <em>Lovely day, isn’t it?</em> Very
often, the point of using a tag question is not to get a specific
confirmation, but simply to signal an openness to interaction.</p>
<p>Be careful with the following irregular tags:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>I’m bad at cooking, aren’t I?</em></p>
<p><em>Don’t be late, will you?</em> &gt;&gt; Imperative</p>
<p><em>Let’s go out, shall we?</em></p>
</div>
