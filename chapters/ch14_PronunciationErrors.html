<p>This chapter presents the most common pronunciation errors for native
speakers of French in particular, but also German and Italian.</p>
<h2 id="stress-the-first-syllable">Stress the first syllable</h2>
<p>Most English words are stressed i nthe first syllable.</p>
<p>Words that are not include</p>
<p>this contrasts sharply with French, in which the last syllable is
always stressed: /mai-SON/, /ve-ri-TE/, /bien-TOT/,
/com-prehen-SION/</p>
<p>Placing the stress in the right place often unlocks or makes it
easier to pronounce the rest of the word correctly. words like</p>
<p>error 1400</p>
<h2 id="s-endings">-s endings</h2>
<p>French speakers: do not forget to pronounce plural “-s”! This is
without a doubt the most common and consistent speaking error that
French speakers make.</p>
<p>Apples, friends, some machines, several computers</p>
<p>I know it is difficult to remember, and it may seem like a trivial
problem, a little detail... but it isn’t! English speakers will think
that you do not know the basic plural form! So please, try to focus on
this. It makes a big difference!</p>
<p>The same applies to 3rd person conjugations in the present simple,
which also have an “-s” ending:</p>
<p>she runs, he jumps, it swims, she checks, he flips, it breaks...</p>
<p>, as explained in section <a href="#e0110" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="e0110">[e0110]</a>, is the very common problem of
forgetting to write or say a plural -s ending.<br />
refers to a similar problem in connection with 3rd personal present
simple conjugations, which require an -s ending.</p>
<h2 id="es-endings">-es endings</h2>
<p>As explained in <a href="#sec:nouns-ending-in-x"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:nouns-ending-in-x">[sec:nouns-ending-in-x]</a> When
a word ends in -x, -ss, -sh, -ch, -ge, or -ce, it is not possible to add
the normal -s ending of the plural or 3rd person singular form. The
problem is that it is impossible to distinguish an -s after -ss, -x,
-sh, etc.</p>
<p>In these cases, the ending changes to “-es”, which is pronounced
/iz/.</p>
<p>foxes, stresses, fixes, passes, washes, catches, changes, faces
/foxiz/, /stressiz/, /fixiz/ /passiz/ /washiz/ /catchiz/ /changiz/
/faciz/</p>
<p>Many students find it difficult to say /iz/ after -x, -ss, -sh, -ch,
-ge and -ce. This common error is known as .<span id="e1401"
label="e1401"></span></p>
<h2 id="ed-verb-endings">-ed verb endings</h2>
<p>Past simple and past participle verbs often have an -ed ending:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>jumped, screamed, dragged, checked, fixed, missed, etc.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These -ed endings are pronounced /d/, not /id/ or /eeed/.</p>

(correct), but as /id/ or /eeed/ (incorrect).<span id="e1402"
label="e1402"></span></p>
<p>There is one important exception to this rule: verbs ending in -t or
-d, such as print and decide. For obvious phonetic reasons, it is nearly
impossible to distinguish a /d/ sound from another /d/ or /t/ sound.
This is why we need to say /id/ or /eeed/ in these cases, creating a
separation between the two identical consonants.</p>

<p>Failing to pronounce -ed endings correctly with verbs ending in -t or
-d results in the following error. refers to the incorrect
pronounciation of -ed after words ending in -d or -t, usually resulting
in the -ed ending being indistinguishable or completely dropped.<span
id="e1403" label="e1403"></span> This pronunciation error is typical
when using two types of words:</p>
<div class="compactenum">
<p>The past forms of verbs ending in -d, -de, -t or -te, including
<em>descend, fold, decide, reside, invent, manifest, print, allocate,
invite, manipulate, originate, unite</em>, etc.</p>
<p>Adjectives ending in -ated, such as <em>complicated and
eliminated</em>, which are often incorrectly pronounced <em>it’s
very</em> or <em>they were</em> .</p>
</div>
<h2 id="sec:pron-ght">-ght endings</h2>
<p>-ght endings are actually quite simple once you understand the rule.
In modern English, -ght is pronounced /t/. You can and should forget the
letters g and h, as they are silent in these endings.</p>
<p>It is important to remember this rule, because the ending occurs in
the past form of several irregular verbs, including:</p>

<p>I doubled the -t in the phonetic transcription to emphasize the fact
that -ght is reduced to a flat -t sound. Notice also how the -ou- and
-au- sounds in the middle of these past forms make a single /o/ or
perhaps /ah/ sound. Avoid pronouncing these vowels as dipthongs /a-u/ or
/o-u/.</p>
<p>The same pronunciation of -ght applies in the words <em>height</em>
(/hait/) and <em>weight</em> (/weit/), which are basic terms for
engineers and architects.</p>
<p>refers to the incorrect pronounciation of -ght endings.<span
id="e1404" label="e1404"></span></p>
<h2 id="sec:pron-gh">-gh endings</h2>
<p>-gh word endings are unpredictable. Sometimes they are completely
silent (unpronounced):</p>
<p>dough (pâte), although (bien que), through (à travers), borough
(quartier) /doe/ /aldoe/ /doe/ /boroe/</p>
<p>Other times, they sound like “ff”:</p>
<p>enough (assez), rough (rugueux), tough (dur), cough (tousser), laugh
(rire) /enoff/ /ruff/ /tuff/ /coff/ /laff/</p>
<p>There is no clear rule when it comes to -gh endings. The best thing
to do is to familiarize oneself with these particular words.</p>
<p>refers to the incorrect pronounciation of -gh endings.<span
id="e1405" label="e1405"></span></p>
<h2 id="h--at-the-beginning-of-words">h- at the beginning of words</h2>
<p>As explained in section ref, an “h” at the beginning of a word has to
be pronounced. The sound is that of a short exhalation.</p>
<p>hotel, heat, hit, home, etc.</p>
<p>If you are a French speaker, this will not be easy for you to
pronouce. Practice making a “g” sound at the begining of the word, like
“gotel” or “gome”, then slowly replace the “g” with an exhalation.</p>
<p>Since “h” is a real consonant, we do not make a liaison between the
article and the beginning of a word that starts with “h”:</p>
<p>Don’t say “an ôtel”. Say “a hotel”. Or: “a *pause* hotel” Don’t say
“an ôme”. Say “a home”. Or: “a *pause* home” refers to the incorrect
pronounciation of h- at the beginning of words.<span id="e1406"
label="e1406"></span></p>
<h2 id="kn--at-the-beginning-of-words">kn- at the beginning of
words</h2>
<p>The “k” at the beginning of a word starting with “kn-“ is usualy
silent.</p>
<p>knee is pronounced /nee/ knowledge is pronounced /noeledge/ refers to
the incorrect pronounciation of kn-.<span id="e1407"
label="e1407"></span></p>
<h2 id="the-palatal-nasal-sound">The palatal nasal sound</h2>
<p>In French and Italian, in the words “agneau” or “bagno”, for example,
the letters “-gn-“ make a nasal sound. Other languages represent this
sound with “nh“ or “ñ”: "Pontinha", "mañana".</p>
<p>This sound does not exist in English. It is a mistake to make this
sound when you say words like:</p>
<p>magnet magnesium signal magnolia signature agnostic ignition
ignore</p>
<p>In these and other words containing “-gn-“, the “g” sound is hard, as
in “go” or “game”.</p>
<p>refers to the incorrect pronounciation of -gn-.<span id="e1408"
label="e1408"></span></p>
<p>Sometimes, as in the word sign, design, foreign, and campaign, the
“g” is not pronounced at all. You have to make a pure “n” sound: /sine/
/desine/ /foren/ /campain/</p>
<h2 id="the-qu-phoneme">The ’qu’ phoneme</h2>
<p>This phoneme is pronounced /kw/ in English (and is similar to German
pronunciation), whereas in French it is pronounced /k/. Examples:</p>
<p>• quality should be pronounced /kwality/ • quantity should be
pronounced /kwantity/ • aqueduct should be pronounced /akweduct/ • quit
should be pronounecd /kwit/ • equal should be pronounced /ekwal/</p>
<p>refers to the incorrect pronounciation of -qu-.<span id="e1409"
label="e1409"></span></p>
<h2 id="ch--at-the-beginning-of-words">ch- at the beginning of
words</h2>
<p>The phoneme ch- at the beginning of the word is not the same as sh-.
From the perspective of a French speaker, ch- should sound like /tch-/
or /tsh-/. Examples: - cheap should be pronounced /tcheap/. If not, it
will sound like sheep (the animal) - choose should be pronounced
/tchoose/. If not, it will sound like shoes. refers to the incorrect
pronounciation of ch-.<span id="e1410" label="e1410"></span></p>
<h2 id="ci--and-ce--for-italian-speakers">ci- and ce- for Italian
speakers</h2>
<p>refers to the incorrect pronounciation of -ce- or -ci- by
Italian-speakers.<span id="e1411" label="e1411"></span></p>
