<h1 id="nouns-and-determiners">Nouns and determiners</h1>
<p>A <span class="smallcaps">noun</span> is a word that refers to a
person, place, thing, or idea. <span
class="smallcaps">Determiners</span> are words that quantify or specify
nouns: they provide information about the number of a noun or about the
specific instance of a noun being referred to. Together, determiners and
nouns make up noun phrases. In the noun phrase <em>many times</em>,
times is the noun and many is the determiner.</p>
<p>The main difficulties in using nouns and determiners have to do with
the fact that a small but important set of nouns is uncountable, which
affects the way the noun can be used, particularly in combination with
determiners.</p>
<h2 id="nouns">Nouns</h2>
<h3 id="plural-forms-of-nouns">Plural forms of nouns</h3>
<p>The plural forms of most nouns is created simply by adding -s:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>2 cars, 3 tables, 4 friends</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adding plural -s is one of the most basic facts of the English
language, yet it causes many problems with French speakers in
particular, because it conflicts with one of the basic rules of the
French language, which is that -s endings are usually silent.</p>
<p>By far the most frequent of all errors for native French speakers
(but frequently for Italian speakers as well) is <span
class="smallcaps">forgetting to pronounce the plural -s</span>.</p>
<p>Yet the plural is not always only a matter of adding an -s. Sometimes
a few additional changes must me made. This can affect the spelling and,
more importantly, the pronunciation of plurals.</p>
<h4 id="nouns-ending-in-consonant--y">Nouns ending in consonant +
-y</h4>
<p>When a noun ends in consonant + -y, the ’y’ is transformed into -ie
before plural -s is added.</p>
<div class="center">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">one baby</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">two babies</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">one party</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">two parties</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>Notice the difference when the -y is preceded by a vowel:</p>
<div class="center">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">one boy</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">two boys</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">one display</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">two displays</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>As you can see, the -ies ending is only used when -y is preceded by a
consonant. This rule only affects the spelling of the word, not its
pronunciation.</p>
<h4 id="sec:nouns-ending-in-x">Nouns ending in -x, -ss,-sh and -ch</h4>
<p>we add -es instead of -s after words that end in consonants that
contain an /s/ sound. These consonants are -ss, -x, -sh, -ch, -ce and
-ge. This rule is not just a matter of spelling, however, as the -es
ending indicates a difference in pronunciation with respect to the -s
ending.</p>
<p>The reason why we add -es instead of -s is that -s sound are not
easily discerned when they follow another /s/ sound. Where does the
first -s end and the second begin? Adding a simple -s after an -x or an
-sh makes it impossible to distinguish the plural -s. This is why we add
-es (pronounced /iz/) instead.</p>

</div>
<p>To repeat, the -es ending after x, ss, sh and ch is not a superficial
detail or just a question of spelling. The difference in spelling
indicates a difference in pronunciation. An -es ending after -x, -ss,
-ch, -sh, -ge and -ce should sound like /iz/, not like /s/.</p>
<p>The failure to understand this rule causes a lot of pronunciation
errors among French speakers, who often find it difficult or feel
uncertain when using plural forms such as <em>masses, indexes, coaches,
crashes, pages or laces</em>, and therefore choose to drop the plural
completely.</p>
<p>refers to the incorrect pronuciation of -es endings and is discussed
in more detail in <a href="#e1401" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="e1401">[e1401]</a>. Though actually the same as error
0110, we classify it separately because it has a particular origin in
the fact that pronouncing -s after consonants that sound like s,
including -ss, -x, -sh, -ch, -ge and -ce, requires a specific extra
effort to say /iz/ at the end of the word.</p>
<h4 id="irregular-plurals">Irregular plurals</h4>
<p>A few English words have irregular plural forms not ending in -s.
Figure <a href="#fig:irregular-plurals" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:irregular-plurals">[fig:irregular-plurals]</a> lists
some of the most common ones.</p>
<p>These irregular plurals have to be memorized.</p>
<p>Note in particular that since <em>men, women, children and
people</em> are plural forms, it is erroneous to say .</p>
<p>By the way, the word <em>women</em> is pronounced /wimin/, not</p>
<p>A note on the word <em>person</em>. As shown in fig. <a
href="#fig:irregular-plurals" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:irregular-plurals">[fig:irregular-plurals]</a>, the
plural form for <em>person</em> is <span
class="smallcaps">people</span>. Actually, the plural form
<em>persons</em> also exists; it is simply used much less often than
<em>people</em>.</p>
<h3 id="plural-nouns">Plural nouns</h3>
<p>Nouns that only exist in plural form are called plural nouns. Plural
nouns should not be used in singular form.</p>
<p>Plural nouns refer to things that by definition exist in pairs or in
sets.</p>
<p>As you can see, these words appear in plural form by default. It
would be an error to say or . Similarly, you cannot use plural nouns
with the indefinite article <em>a</em>, <em>an</em>, or any other
determiners that would define them as single units (such as
<em>each</em> and <em>every</em>). We usually describe these objects as
pairs: <em>a pair of pants</em>, or simply without quantifiers:
<em>glasses, scissors</em>.</p>
<p>Architects should note that <em>stairs, eaves, and French
windows</em> are plural nouns. It would be wrong to say or or .</p>
<p>An important plural noun is <em>data</em>. Data can be considered a
plural noun because the singular form <em>datum</em> is practically
never used. As a plural form, <em>data</em> cannot be treated as a
single unit: you should avoid saying or (say <em>the data, this data,
data, a piece of data, etc.</em>). In particular, please note that the
plural form does not exist! <em>Data</em> itself is a plural form.</p>
<p>English has a few other plural forms ending in -a. most of these are
Greek or Latin words that were integrated without modification into the
English language. They include <em>criteria</em> (singular form is
criterion); <em>phenomena</em> (singular = phenomenon);
<em>bacteria</em> (this is also the singular form). All of these words
ending in -a are plural forms, so a plural -s ending should never be
added: (, ).</p>
<h3 id="singular-forms-that-end-in--s">Singular forms that end in
-s</h3>
<p>These are words with -s endings in their <strong>singular
form</strong>! Despite their -s endings, the following words should not
be taken for plural forms!</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p>a series: <em>Frank completed one series of math problems.</em></p>
<p>a species: <em>This species of frog is seriously endangered.</em></p>
<p>a means: <em>Buses are an efficient means of transportation.</em></p>
<p>the news: <em>The news is not good.</em> &gt;&gt; Not "These
<del>are</del> bad news"!<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>an analysis: <em>The analysis was inconclusive.</em> &gt;&gt; Not
"The was inconclusive."</p>
<p>economics: <em>Economics is a booming academic field.</em> &gt;&gt;
Not " are..."</p>
<p>electronics: <em>Electronics can be a challenging profession.</em>
&gt;&gt; Not " can be a challengig profession"</p>
</div>
<p>The names of other scientific and professional domains can be added
to this list, including maths, physics, mechanics, politics, aesthetics
and gymnastics.</p>
<p>A very common error is to remove the "-s" from these words, as if it
was a plural -s: "I am watching a good " or "I have a good " or "I study
" or "Bicycles are the best of transportation"…</p>
<p>In case you were wondering, the plural forms of <em>series, species
and means</em> are also <em>series, species and means</em>.</p>
<h3 id="compound-nouns">Compound nouns</h3>
<p>Compound nouns are two or more nouns used together to mean one thing.
Some examples are <em>a tennis ball; a bank manager; a road accident;
the building safety inspector</em>. The important thing to remember
about compound nouns is that plural forms are generally avoided within
the compound noun; only the last noun can have a plural form.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p>A building with 10 stories is <span class="smallcaps">a ten-story
building</span>.</p>
<p>A journey that takes three hours is <span class="smallcaps">a
three-hour journey</span>.</p>
<p>A course that lasts four weeks is <span class="smallcaps">a four-week
course</span>.</p>
<p>A woman who is 30 years old is <span class="smallcaps">a 30-year-old
woman</span>.</p>
<p>A letter consisting of six pages is <span class="smallcaps">a
six-page letter</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>The reason for this rule is that the first noun or nouns in a
compound noun behave like adjectives: their job is to modify the second
noun. Adjectives in the English language do not agree with the noun they
modify, which means they are not used in plural form (see <a
href="#sec:adjective-basics" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:adjective-basics">[sec:adjective-basics]</a>).</p>
<p>If you are wondering about the use of the hyphen or dash in a
compound noun, we use it to clarify which words are part of the
compound, and reflects the fact that the group of words is pronounced
faster than they normally would be. If you see <em>30-year-old</em> in a
book, you will know that you can say it faster than <em>30 year
old</em>. Use of the hyphen is not obligatory, however.</p>
<p>Sometimes we write compound words as one word (<em>weekend</em>), and
sometimes as two separate words (<em>bank account</em>). There are no
clear rules for this. If you are not sure, write two words.</p>
<p>Compound nouns are used extensively in English. Using compound nouns
usually results in more economical, and thus more elegant, language,
than when possessives or prepositions are used. In general, for
example,</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p>the <span class="smallcaps">race car</span> is more elegant than ’the
car for racing’</p>
<p>an <span class="smallcaps">ice-cream cone</span> is more elgant than
’a cone of ice-cream’</p>
<p>the <span class="smallcaps">research institute</span> is more elegant
than ’the institute of research’, or ’the institute for research’</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Harvard Law School</span> is more elegant
than ’the school of Law of Harvard’, or ’Harvard’s School of Law’</p>
</div>
<h3 id="countable-vs-uncountable-nouns">Countable vs uncountable
nouns</h3>
<p>Some nouns, like <em>car</em> or <em>dog</em>, refer to things that
are normally treated as units, or discrete objects. Discrete objects can
be counted, which is why these nouns are called <span
class="smallcaps">countable nouns</span>. We can easily say <em>2
cars</em> and <em>3 dogs</em>.</p>
<p>Because they can be counted,</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p>countable nouns can be preceded by an indefinite article <em>a</em>
or <em>an</em>, or by the number <em>one</em>. Examples: <em>one car, a
day, an idea</em></p>
<p>countable nouns can appear in plural form: <em>two cars, a few days,
some ideas</em></p>
</div>
<p>The same cannot be said about another category of nouns that, like
<em>water</em> and <em>salt</em>, refer to things that are difficult to
imagine as discrete objects or units. Instead, <em>Water</em> and
<em>salt</em> are usually perceived as indivisible masses. This type of
word is called an <span class="smallcaps">uncountable noun</span>, and
they follow the following rules:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p>Uncountable nouns exist in singular form (<em>water, salt,
information</em>), not in plural form ()<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Uncountable nouns cannot be preceded by <em>a, an, or one</em>, since
they cannot be treated as units (, , , etc.). Uncountable nouns are
often used in singular form but without an article: <em>Water boils at
100 degrees; Information is the key</em>.</p>
<p>They can be used with the determiners <em>some, a lot of, a
little</em>. Examples: <em>Some oil must be applied, A lot of time was
needed, Add a little sugar</em>, etc. See section <a
href="#subsec:Quantifiers" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="subsec:Quantifiers">1.2.3</a> for more information on
these determiners.</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:uncountable-nouns" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:uncountable-nouns">[fig:uncountable-nouns]</a>
presents the most important and often-used uncountable nouns.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to study this box carefully. But if you memorize
only three words from the box, take <em>information, knowledge and
research</em>, since their equivalent in French is countable (<em>les
informations, les connaissances, les recherches</em>), leading to
transfer errors.</p>
<p>To summarize, uncountable nouns can only be used in the following
ways:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p>in singular form (no -s): <em>furniture, greenery</em></p>
<p>in singular conjugation: <em>water boils, information is available,
knowledge was shared, glass doesn’t break</em></p>
<p>with determiners such as <span class="smallcaps">some, a lot
of</span> and <span class="smallcaps">a little</span>: <em>some
information, a little work</em></p>
</div>
<p>Let us now review the restrictions that apply to uncountable nouns.
They are listed in connection with a specific error.</p>
<p>is caused by treating an uncountable word as a single unit by
preceding it with the word <em>one</em>, the indefinite article
<em>a</em>, or count determiners such as <em>each</em> and
<em>every</em>.. Remember that uncountable nouns cannot be used with
articles and other determiners that treat words as single units (, ,
).</p>
<p>is caused by using an countabable noun in plural form. Avoid forms
such as , and <em>of Matlab</em>. By the same logic, always avoid plural
conjugations: <em></em>, <em>available</em>, <em>shared</em>,
<em>break</em>.</p>
<p>refers to incorrectly using counting quantifiers such as
<em>many</em> and <em>several</em> with uncountable nouns. The problem
arises from the fact that these quantifiers treat words as multiple
units (, ). See <a href="#subsec:Quantifiers" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="subsec:Quantifiers">1.2.3</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Uncountable nouns are notoriously difficult for learners of English
because of these restrictions as well as the fact that a few words that
are uncountable un English are perfectly countable in languages such as
French and German. <em>Information</em> and <em>knowledge</em> are the
two most important examples.</p>
<p>To help you to avoid some common mistakes with countable nouns,
figure <a href="#fig:countable-options" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:countable-options">1.1</a> lists some of the the
countable alternatives to frequently used uncountable nouns.</p>
<figure id="fig:countable-options">
<img src="images/countable_options.png" style="width:80.0%" />
<figcaption>Countable alternatives for uncountable nouns</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="sec:Determiners">Determiners</h2>
<p>Determiners are words that give information about the quantity,
real-world location, or distribution of a noun. You can think of them as
anchoring a noun in the real world (<em>this fish</em>) as opposed to
simply modifying the noun, the way adjectives do (<em>red fish</em>).
Determiners are usually part of a noun phrase as syntactical children of
a noun. As you can imagine, the properties of the given noun (plural
noun? countable? uncountable?) restrict the types of determiners that it
can combine with. We will discuss this in detail in the following
pages.</p>
<p>There are a few categories of determiners, including articles (a,
the), demonstratives (this, that, these, those), and quantifiers (much,
many, some, several, etc).</p>
<h3 id="subsec:Articles">Articles</h3>
<p>Articles are placed in front of a noun. They tell us if the noun is
definite (specific, already known) or indefinite (used in general, not
as a specific or previously identified instance).</p>
<h4 id="the-indefinite-article-a-or-an">The indefinite article <span
class="smallcaps">a</span> or <span class="smallcaps">an</span></h4>
<p>The indefinite article <span class="smallcaps">a</span> has a meaning
similar to <em>one</em>. For this reason, it should not be used with
uncountable and plural nouns, which cannot be treated as units.</p>
<p>It is called indefinite because it indicates that you are not
referring to a specific instance of the noun. <em>A car</em> is a
reference to any car, not to a specific one (as opposed to when you say
<em>the car</em>). Similarly, <em>car</em> is a reference to all cars,
or to cars in general.</p>
<p>The indefinite article <span class="smallcaps">a</span> becomes <span
class="smallcaps">an</span> in front of words that start with a vowel.
This allows for a better flow of sound (known as a liaison):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>an animal, an elephant, an island, an old man, an ultrasound, an
umpire</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An exception to this rule are words beginning with u- when u- is
pronounced /iu/ instead of /uh/</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>a university, a unicorn, a uniform, a ukalele, a unique
person</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason why we use <em>a</em> instead of <em>an</em> in these
cases is that the sound /iu/ makes liaison difficult with <em>an</em>.
Try it for yourself!</p>
<p>refers to the incorrect choice of <span class="smallcaps">a</span> or
<span class="smallcaps">an</span>.</p>
<p>Another common error with the indifinite article is related to the
pronunciation of the letter h- at the begining of words.</p>
<p>In English, the letter <span class="smallcaps">h</span> is not
’invisible’ the way it is in French. The h- sound might be subtle, but
it is always pronounced: it is the sound of breathing out or exhalation.
For this reason, we do not use the article “an” to make a liaison with
words that start with h.</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>a hotel</em></p>
<p><em>a hill</em></p>
<p><em>a helicopter</em></p>
</div>
<p>The sound of an h- in English is almost exactly the opposite of the
h- in French, which requires you to breathe in or inhale. This is why it
can be difficult for French speakers to pronounce English h- words and
to avoid liaisons with the article.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="the-definite-article-the">The definite article "the"</h4>
<p>The definite article “the” is used to refer to specific things, that
is things that are already known by the speaker or that have been
mentioned before.</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>the old house in my neighborhood</em> is a specific house</p>
<p><em>the friend I told you about</em> is an already-mentioned
person</p>
<p><em>the sun, the moon, the air, the sky</em> are specific, well-known
bodies or elements</p>
<p><em>the Nile River, the Pacific Ocean, the Sarine</em> are famous
bodies of water</p>
</div>
<p>Do not use the definite article <span class="smallcaps">the</span>
when referring to things in general:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>Old houses must be renovated.</em> &gt;&gt; means all old houses
(don’t say must...)</p>
<p><em>Steel is a useful material.</em> &gt;&gt; means steel in general
(don’t say is a useful material)</p>
<p><em>Rivers must be kept clean.</em> refers to all rivers (don’t say
must be kept clean)</p>
<p><em>Oxygen is unstable.</em> &gt;&gt; means oxygen in general (don’t
say )</p>
</div>
<p>We also avoid using <span class="smallcaps">the</span> with words for
ideas and abstractions such as <em>beauty, time, evil, evolution,
nature</em>, etc. <em>Nature</em> in particular can be difficult to use
correctly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The project is in intense dialogue with nature (not "with ")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Avoid saying "the nature" when talking about nature in general–nature
as a concept.</p>
<p>There is another common problem with the article <span
class="smallcaps">the</span>. In French, it is normal to use ’le’ or
’la’ in reference to a country: <em>la France, l’Italie</em>. In
English, we do this only when countries have plural names.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><u>The Netherlands</u> are playing <u>the United States</u> in
tonight’s rugby match.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is incorrect (and a common error) to apply the definite article to
the name of a country whose name is not plural:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is beautiful, is magical</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have to say <em>Switzerland is beautiful</em> and <em>Spain is
magical</em>.</p>
<h3 id="subsec:Demonstratives">Demonstratives</h3>
<p>Demonstratives indicate the real-world position of a noun in relation
to the speaker. The choice of demonstrative is governed by two factors:
whether the noun is singular or plural, and whether the object is
(relatively) near to, or far from, the speaker.</p>
<figure id="fig:demonstratives">
<img src="images/demonstratives.png" style="width:70.0%" />
<figcaption>Demonstrative determiners</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>This house</em> (here)</p>
<p><em>That house</em> (there)</p>
<p><em>These houses</em> (here)</p>
<p><em>Those houses</em> (there)</p>
</div>
<p>Just as we obviously should not use the singular demonstratives
(<em>this</em> and <em>that</em>) with plurals nouns such as
<em>stairs</em>, we should also avoid using plural demonstratives
(<em>these</em> and <em>those</em>) with uncountable words such as
<em>information</em>.</p>
<h3 id="subsec:Quantifiers">Quantifiers</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, quantifiers indicate the quantity of a noun.
Using quantifiers is sometimes difficult because they have to be
coordinated with the properties of the noun. Some determiners can be
used freely with nouns of any kind, but a few important determiners are
governed by clear restrictions.</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p>Is the noun singular or plural?</p>
<p>Is the noun countable or uncountable?</p>
</div>
<p>Let us begin with quantifiers that can be used without
restrictions.</p>
<h4 id="quantifiers-used-without-noun-restrictions">Quantifiers used
without noun restrictions</h4>
<p>The following quantifiers can be used without noun restrictions, but
you often have to pay attention to other rules of usage.</p>
<h5 id="a-lot-of">A lot of</h5>
<p><span class="smallcaps">A lot of</span> can be used with countable
nouns in plural form and with uncountable nouns in singular form.
Examples: <em>I have a lot of money; He stole a lot of information; I
have a lot of friends; I have a lot of cars.</em></p>
<h5 id="some">Some</h5>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Some</span> can be used with both countable
(<em>some cars</em>) and uncountable nouns (<em>some information</em>).
Notice in the latter case that the uncountable noun remains in singular
form. <span class="smallcaps">Some</span> is most commonly used in
positive sentences to indicate a positive quantity (<em>I have some
bottles of water in my bag; I have some wine in the cellar</em>). It is
also used in questions that make an offer of a positive quantity of
something: <em>Would you like some wine? Would you like to take some
bottles with you?</em></p>
<h5 id="any">Any</h5>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Any</span> is often used in negative
sentences: <em>Sorry, I don’t have any water; I didn’t receive any
messages</em>. Note that it is ok to use <span
class="smallcaps">any</span> with a noun in plural form (<em>I don’t
have any coins left</em>); this is unlike the French grammar rule for
"pas de + nom au singulier". <span class="smallcaps">Any</span> is also
commonly used in speculative questions: <em>Are there any bottles in the
bag? Do you have any wine?</em> A speculative question means that your
are not offering something concrete, but rather unsure if the what you
are asking for is even available. Finally, when <span
class="smallcaps">any</span> is used in positive sentences, it takes on
the meaning <em>it doesn’t matter which</em>; for example: <em>You can
play any song you like</em>.</p>
<h5 id="no">No</h5>
<p><span class="smallcaps">No</span> is used in positively conjugated
sentences to express a negation: <em>I have no friends; I have no
money</em>.</p>
<h5 id="enough">Enough</h5>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Enough</span> expresses that a quantity is
sufficient. It is used with both countable (<em>enough days</em>) and
uncountable (<em>enough money</em>) nouns. You can check the
pronunciation rule for <span class="smallcaps">enough</span> in <a
href="#sec:pron-gh" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:pron-gh">[sec:pron-gh]</a>. The most important thing
to remember about <span class="smallcaps">enough</span> is the following
rule:</p>
<p>Examples: <em>I have enough time to do this</em> (enough + noun);
<em>I am not strong enough to do this</em> (adjective + enough).</p>
<h4 id="determiners-with-noun-restrictions">Determiners with noun
restrictions</h4>
<p>The following determiners are restricted to nouns in either singular
or plural form and to countable or uncountable nouns.</p>
<h5 id="each-and-every">EACH and EVERY</h5>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Each</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">every</span> are always followed by <span
class="smallcaps">countable nouns in singular form</span>. Say:
<em>every friend</em> and <em>every day</em>, not or . <span
class="smallcaps">Each</span> and <span class="smallcaps">every</span>
quantify things as units (units within a group). For this reason, they
cannot be used with uncountable nouns such as equipment, infrastructure,
information, etc. But should we choose between ’each’ and ’every’?
Despite being very similar to each other, there is a subtle difference
of perspective involved in the choice. While ’Each’ focuses on the unit,
’every’ stresses the individual unit as belonging a group. Examples:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>Each Lindt praliné is meticulously checked before being
wrapped.</em> (= emphasis on the individual)</p>
<p><em>I do the same morning ritual every day.</em> (=emphasis on the
repetition over a set of days)</p>
</div>
<p>In practice, this difference is admittedly difficult to explain and
defend. It is often possible to use each and every interchangeably, as
captured in the common expression <em>each and every</em>. Example:
<em>Each and every audience member will receive a free set of Beats
headphones</em>.</p>
<h5 id="several">SEVERAL</h5>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Several</span>, like the French
<em>plusieurs</em>, is used with countable nouns in plural form only:
<em>several weeks, several individuals</em>, etc. Please note that
’several’ is by definition a plural determiner; do not add a plural -s
to ’several’ ()!</p>
<h5 id="many-vs-much">MANY vs MUCH</h5>
<p>We use <span class="smallcaps">many</span> with countable nouns in
plural form. Since <span class="smallcaps">many</span> expresses
quantity in numbers, the noun it quantifies must be in plural form.
Remember that uncountable nouns by definition do not appear in plural
form.</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>I have many friends.</em></p>
<p><em>I don’t have many days to live.</em></p>
</div>
<p>In contrast, we use <span class="smallcaps">much</span> with in
uncountable nouns, and usually in negative sentences:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>We don’t have much time.</em></p>
<p><em>I don’t have much information on the subject.</em></p>
</div>
<p>In positive sentences involving uncountable nouns, it is far more
common to use <span class="smallcaps">a lot of</span>: <em>I have <u>a
lot of</u> dangerous information</em> vs <em>I have dangerous
information</em>. On the whole, it is relatively rare to use the
determiner <span class="smallcaps">much</span> by itself in this
way.</p>
<h5 id="too-many-vs-too-much">TOO MANY vs TOO MUCH</h5>
<p>These quantifiers signal excessive quantity. The
countable/uncountable restrictions described in the point above apply
here as well: <span class="smallcaps">many</span> is used with
uncountable nouns, <span class="smallcaps">much</span> with
uncountables.</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p>COUNTABLE: <em>I have too many friends. / I don’t have too many coins
left.</em></p>
<p>UNCOUNTABLE: <em>There’s too much milk in my coffee. / I don’t have
too much time left.</em></p>
</div>
<h5 id="few-vs-little">FEW vs LITTLE</h5>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Few</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">little</span> indicate a small quantity of something.
They behave similarly to many-much: we use <span
class="smallcaps">few</span> with plural countable nouns: <em>I have few
friends.</em> In contrast, we use <span class="smallcaps">little</span>
with uncountable nouns: <em>I have little time left</em>. Be careful not
to confuse the determiner <span class="smallcaps">little</span> with the
adjective ’little’. DETERMINER: <em>A little coffee, please</em> = a
small quantity of coffee. ADJECTIVE: <em>Oh, look, a little mouse!</em>
= a small mouse.</p>
<p>The use of the indefinite article <em>a</em> or <em>an</em> in front
of <em>few</em> and <em>little</em> gives the phrase a positive
connotation. Omitting the article gives the phrase a negative
connotation. Examples:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>I have a few good friends. I’m a lucky guy.</em></p>
<p><em>I have few good friends. It’s hard to find people I can
trust.</em></p>
<p><em>I have a little money. We can definitely go on a weekend trip to
Paris.</em></p>
<p><em>I have little money right now. I can’t come with you this
time.</em></p>
</div>
<h5 id="both-either-neither">BOTH, EITHER, NEITHER</h5>
<p>The determiners in this trio are complementary to each other in much
the same way as <span class="smallcaps">some-any-no</span>, as explained
in Fig. <a href="#some-any-no" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="some-any-no">[some-any-no]</a>. The difference is that
<span class="smallcaps">both-either-neither</span> are used exclusively
with pairs or binomials; that is, they refer specifically to two
things.</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p>BOTH means A <u>and</u> B</p>
<p>EITHER means A <u>or</u> B</p>
<p>NEITHER means <u>not</u> A <u>and not</u> B</p>
</div>
<p>Once again, use these words with two nouns. More precisely, we use
them with two <u>countable</u> nouns (entailed by the number two). In
other words, avoid saying or . Examples: <em>Both children are smart.
Either option is good. Neither team will make the playoffs.</em></p>
<p>When using<span class="smallcaps">both, either or neither</span> with
noun phrases begining with an article (<em>the kids</em>), a
demonstrative (<em>these kids</em>), or a possessive adjective (<em>my
kids</em>), you need to include the preposition <span
class="smallcaps">of</span>. Examples: <em>Both of them. Either of these
options is good. Neither of the rivals will make the playoffs.</em></p>
