<h1 id="adjectives-and-adverbs">Adjectives and adverbs</h1>
<p>Adjectives and adverbs are modifiers, or words that modify other
words. Adjectives modify nouns. Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives or
other adverbs.</p>
<h2 id="sec:adjective-basics">Basic rules for adjectives</h2>
<p>The function of an adjective is to give information about a noun.</p>
<h5 id="rule-1-position">Rule 1: Position</h5>
<p>Adjectives are placed before the noun: <em>a red apple, the small
house</em>. Contrast this with French and Italian, where the adjective
usually follows the noun: ’une victoire sublime’, ’une défaite
cuisante’</p>
<h5 id="rule-2-no-declension">Rule 2: No declension </h5>
<p>Adjectives are not declined for number or gender. In other words,
they never have a plural ending or a feminine form. Example:</p>
<div class="center">
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;"><strong>English</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: center;"><strong>French</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: center;"><strong>German</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">a strong man</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">un homme fort</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">ein starke<span
style="color: red">r</span> Mann</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">two strong men</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">deux hommes fort<span
style="color: red">s</span></td>
<td style="text-align: center;">zwei starke Männer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">a strong woman</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">une femme fort<span
style="color: red">e</span></td>
<td style="text-align: center;">eine starke Frau</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">two strong women</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">deux femmes fort<span
style="color: red">es</span></td>
<td style="text-align: center;">zwei starke Frauen</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>As you see in the absence of red-colored endings, in English the form
of the adjective never changes, and changes in the noun’s number and
gender have no impact on the adjective. Compare this to French, where
the adjective takes on four different endings depending on the
combination of person and gender. You can also compare with German (if
you are brave): in addition person and, not two, but three genders, the
grammatical case (nominative, accusative, etc.) has to be considered as
well, leading to more than a dozen different word endings for
adjectives!</p>
<h2 id="numbers">Numbers</h2>
<p>Since numbers are words that usually modify nouns, we can think of
them as adjectives. Here we will recall a few basic rules about using
numbers.</p>
<h5 id="pronunciation">PRONUNCIATION</h5>
<p>Be careful with the pronunciation of numbers 13 to 19 on the one
hand, and 30 to 90 on the other:</p>
<div class="center">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">13 /thir-TEEN/</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">30 /THIR-ty/</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">14 /four-TEEN/</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">40 /FOR-ty/</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">15 /fif-TEEN/</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">50 /FIF-ty/</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">16 /six-TEEN/</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">60 /SIX-ty/</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<h5 id="one-hundred">ONE HUNDRED</h5>
<p>The number 120 is read <em>one hundred and twenty</em>, not (do not
forget the ’one’!). Similarly, say <em>one thousand horses</em>; not
.</p>
<h5 id="no-plural--s-after-hundred-thousand-million">NO PLURAL -S AFTER
HUNDRED, THOUSAND, MILLION</h5>
<div class="compactitem">
<p>200 USD = <em>two hundred dollars</em>, not</p>
<p>5’000 soldiers is <em>five thousand soldiers</em>, not</p>
<p>10’000’000 tons is <em>ten million tons</em>, not</p>
</div>
<p>Why? This is related to point 2.1.b above: adjectives are never
modified.</p>
<h5 id="years">YEARS</h5>
<p>Years are not read like normal numbers. To read out a year, divide it
in two parts:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p>1869 = eighteen sixty-nine</p>
<p>1999 = nineteen ninety-nine</p>
<p>2010 = twenty ten</p>
</div>
<p>There are some special cases, however:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p>1800 = eighteen hundred</p>
<p>1900 = nineteen hundred</p>
<p>2000 = two thousand</p>
<p>2001 = two thousand and one</p>
<p>2009 = two thousand and nine</p>
</div>
<h2 id="adjective-comparison">Adjective comparison</h2>
<p>This section discusses rules for the formation of comparative forms
using adjectives.</p>
<h3 id="comparative-and-superlative-forms">Comparative and superlative
forms</h3>
<h3 id="expressions-with-comparatives">Expressions with
comparatives</h3>
<h5 id="better-and-better">BETTER AND BETTER</h5>
<p>We repeat comparatives to say that something changes
continuously:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Video card performance is getting better and better; The weather
is getting worse and worse.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="the-more-the-more">THE MORE…, THE MORE…</h5>
<p>We often use two comparatives to describe a correlation:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>The more you risk, the more you leave behind</em></p>
<p><em>The more I learn, the less I know.</em></p>
<p><em>Come to the party, of course! The more the merrier!</em></p>
<p><em>The higher they rise, the harder they fall.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Compare this with the analogous French expression, for example:
<em>Plus tu essaies d’oublier une personne, plus tu penses à elle</em>.
Notice that there is no article (’le’) in the French expression, whereas
in English you need to say <span class="smallcaps">the + comparative …,
the + comparative …</span></p>
<div class="center">

<th style="text-align: center;"><strong>English</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: center;"><strong>French</strong></th>

<td style="text-align: center;">the faster, the better</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">plus c’est rapide, mieux c’est</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">plus on est de fous, plus on rit</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

</div>
<h3 id="intensified-comparison">Intensified comparison</h3>
<p>We can instensify a comparison by placing certain adverbs before the
comparative adjective.</p>
<h5 id="a-lot-much">A LOT, MUCH</h5>
<p>We can place <span class="smallcaps">a lot</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">much</span> in front of a comparative adjective to
make it more intense-sounding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It is a lot easier to use; Oh, this is much better!; This is much
more convincing!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="even">EVEN</h5>
<p>The adverb <span class="smallcaps">even</span> can also add emphasis
to a comparative: <em>She finished the project even faster than
expected; It was even better than I thought.</em> Using <span
class="smallcaps">even</span> expresses a feeling of surprise with a
result.</p>
<h3 id="equality">Equality</h3>
<p>To say that two things are equal, use the preposition <span
class="smallcaps">as + adjective + as …</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Your chances of winning are as good as mine; Superman is as fast
as a speeding bullet.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="intensifiers">Intensifiers</h2>
<p>Intensifiers make the meaning of other words stronger.</p>
<h3 id="such-and-so">Such and so</h3>
<h5 id="such">SUCH</h5>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Such</span> is used in combination with noun
phrases which typically include an adjective.</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>It was such a stupid story!</em></p>
<p><em>I had such a great time in Vegas that I feel like a new
person.</em></p>
<p><em>Liz and Joe are such nice, welcoming people.</em></p>
<p><em>I’ve never heard such nonsense!</em></p>
</div>
<p>In these examples, the red part is a noun phrase, i.e. a noun and an
accompanying adjectives and article. As you can see in the following
example, uncountable nouns (<em>weather</em>) do not have an
accompanying indefinite article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We had such lovely weather in Portugal!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="so">SO</h5>
<p><span class="smallcaps">So</span>, on the other hand, modifies a
single adjective or adverb, not a noun phrase. Examples:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>That was so stupid.</em></p>
<p><em>She’s so nice!</em></p>
<p><em>I’m so tired that I could sleep for days.</em></p>
<p><em>He ran away so quickly that he almost broke the door.</em></p>
</div>
<p><span class="smallcaps">So</span> can be used with nouns if it is
combined with the quantifiers <span class="smallcaps">much</span> or
<span class="smallcaps">many</span>:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>I saw so many groundhogs in the Alps this summer. / We used so
many boxes!</em> (’groundhogs’ and ’boxes’ are countable nouns)</p>
<p><em>There’s so much traffic these days. / We consume so much
information!</em> (’traffic’ and ’information’ are uncountable)</p>
</div>
<h3 id="adverb-intensifiers">Adverb intensifiers</h3>
<h5 id="adverb-intensifiers-1">ADVERB INTENSIFIERS</h5>
<p>Adverbs can be used to intensify an adjective to different degrees:
<span class="smallcaps">quite, rather, pretty, very, highly, completely,
totally, entirely, thoroughly, super, incredibly, extremely,</span> etc.
Examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This is highly recommendable; We are extremely lucky.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="adverb-distancers">ADVERB DISTANCERS</h5>
<p>The opposite of an intensifier is an adverb that “creates distance
from” an adjective to make it seem less strong, concrete or certain.
This includes adverbs such as <span class="smallcaps">relatively,
somewhat, fairly, rather, quite, pretty, mostly,</span> etc. This type
of adverb is essential to scientific writing as it expresses a prudent
and careful attitude. Examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Results are mostly positive.; The project has been relatively
successful.; The discovery was somewhat surprising.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="often-confused-adverbs">Often-confused adverbs</h2>
<h5 id="near-and-nearby">NEAR AND NEARBY</h5>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Near</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">nearby</span> can be used as either adjectives or
adverbs, and they express the same thing: closeness.</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>My house is near. My house is nearby.</em></p>
<p><em>My cousin lives near. She lives nearby.</em></p>
</div>
<p>You can use either <span class="smallcaps">near</span> or <span
class="smallcaps">nearby</span> without restriction as long as you do
not answer the question <em>near where?</em>. If you provide an object,
you have to use <span class="smallcaps">near</span>, not <span
class="smallcaps">nearby</span>:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p>CORRECT: <em>My house is near the station. My cousin lives near
here.</em></p>
<p>INCORRECT: <em>My house is . My cousin lives .</em></p>
</div>
<p>Notice that the prepositional phrase "near + a place" does not
include the word "to". It is a very common error to say "I live the
lake".</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Close</span> and near are synonyms. The same
reasoning applies to the use of close and .</p>
<h5 id="well">WELL</h5>
<p>The adverb well indicates that an action is being done correctly:
<em>Construction is advancing well. This is well done. I can read the
language well, but I’m bad at speaking.</em></p>
<p>If you are a German-speaker, be careful not to say ’good’ in such
situations (). For more details, see the top ten vocabulary errors at
the end of the book.</p>
<p>Well is also an adjective meaning “in good health”. This meaning of
"well" is similar to German “wohl”. You can say, for example: <em>I feel
well, I am not well, Are you doing well? These holidays did me
well.</em></p>
<p>refers to the incorrect use of good instead of well. See ref for more
information.</p>
<h5 id="hard-and-hardly">HARD AND HARDLY</h5>
<p>Hard can be an adjective or an adverb:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>This is hard work</em> (adjective modifying the noun ’work’)</p>
<p><em>I always work hard</em> (adverb modifying the verb ’work’)</p>
</div>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Hardly</span> means “only a little” or “just
in a small way”. It can also be an adjective or an adverb depending on
how it is used.</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>This is hardly a meal.</em> (adj) = This is only minimally a
meal.</p>
<p><em>I can hardly hear you.</em> (adv) = I can hear you only
minimally.</p>
</div>
<p>necessarily where, fortunately</p>
<h2 id="temporal-adverbs">Temporal adverbs</h2>
<h5 id="ago">AGO</h5>
<p>Ago indicates how far in the past an action happened. The action has
to be complete, or finished: <em>I obtained my degree ten years ago. I
got married 9 years ago.</em> Ago is analogous to German “vor”. This
leads some students to incorrectly use English “for” instead of “ago”.
Be careful! (Don’t say )</p>
<h5 id="since-and-for">SINCE and FOR</h5>
<p>These two adverbs have the same function: they help define durations,
i.e. periods of time. However, they are used differently. <span
class="smallcaps">Since</span> is used in combination with the starting
point of a period of time, while <span class="smallcaps">for</span> is
used with entire period or duration. Examples:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>I have lived in Rome since 1999. I have lived there for 24
years.</em> &gt;&gt; 1999 is the starting point; 24 years is the
duration</p>
<p><em>It has been raining since yesterday. It has been raining for 24
hours straight.</em> &gt;&gt; ’yesterday’ is the starting point; 24
hours is the duration</p>
</div>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Since</span> must be used with a period of
time that continues until the moment of speaking (the present). <span
class="smallcaps">For</span> can be used in such cases too, but it also
works with periods of time that are complete, i.e. finished in the past
(<em>I worked as a policeman for 5 years, between 2004 and
2009.</em>).</p>
<h5 id="never-and-ever">NEVER and EVER</h5>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Never</span> is used to communicate the
complete absence of an action or event in the past, present, or future.
Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I have never been to France.</em> (Je ne suis jamais allé en
France.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means the person has not visited France at any point in their
life.</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Ever</span> (un jour, quelquefois, jamais?)
is used to <em>ask about</em> or indicate the possibility of an action
or event happening at any time. It asks about the existence of the
action or event at an unspecified point. Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Have you ever been to France?</em> (Es-tu déjà allé en France
?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We see that this question asks if the person has visited France at
any point, without specifying when. This is not the same as stating the
absence of this event.</p>
<p>Another common error with <span class="smallcaps">ever</span> is to
use it like <span class="smallcaps">always</span>:</p>
<p>refers to the incorrect use of ever or never.</p>
<h5 id="already-and-yet">ALREADY and YET</h5>
<p>We use already to confirm that something has happened: “It’s 9AM and
I’m already hungry.” “It’s 3 PM and Jonathan has already left.” “Don’t
get angry, I’ve done it already.” To ask if something has happened or
not, we use yet. “Have you done it yet?” “Are we there yet?” To say that
something has not happened, we also use yet. “I haven’t done it yet.”
“No, we aren’t there yet.” “Not yet.” As you can see, already and yet
are complementary in terms of what types of sentences (positive,
negative, or question) they are used in. Note: do not confuse German
jetzt with English “yet”.</p>
<h5 id="still-and-anymore">STILL and ANYMORE</h5>
<p>We use <span class="smallcaps">still</span> to say that a situation
or action is not finished yet: <em>I’m still working; He is still on the
phone.</em></p>
<p>A common error is to use <span class="smallcaps">always</span>
instead of still.</p>
<p>To say that a situation has changed, we use a negative conjugation +
anymore or any longer:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>Saul is not a lawyer anymore.</em></p>
<p><em>He doesn’t work here anymore.</em></p>
<p><em>I don’t want to stay here any longer.</em></p>
</div>
</body>
