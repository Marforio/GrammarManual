<h1 id="verb-conjugation-rules">Verb conjugation rules</h1>
<p>The conjugated verb is the central element of the sentence.
Understanding and practicing conjugation rules is one of the most
important steps in learning a language. Fortunately for us, English has
relatively simple verb conjugation rules. What is conjugation?
Conjugating a verb simply means changing it to fit a specific subject
and a type of sentence. Conjugation gives clarity to the connection
between the subject (the agent) and the verb (the action). It also helps
communicate the intention of the speaker. There are two ways to change a
verb. These are illustrated in figure <a
href="#fig:dimensions-of-conjugation" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:dimensions-of-conjugation">1.1</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>A verb conjugation is affected on the one hand by the person and
number of the subject. Changing the subject from ’I’ to ’She’ will
impact the verb in many cases. This is represented by the y-axis in
figure <a href="#fig:dimensions-of-conjugation"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:dimensions-of-conjugation">1.1</a>. On the other
hand, the speaker’s intention, as represented by the type of sentence
(declarative, negative, question) will also affect the verb conjugation.
Making a declarative statement, a negative statement of asking a
question will impact the position of the verb on the sentence. Each of
these aspects of conjugation follows a relatively simple set of
rules.</p>
<h2 id="the-components-of-a-conjugated-verb">The components of a
conjugated verb</h2>
<p>A conjugated verb has three main parts: the subject, the auxiliary
verb and the principal verb.</p>
<p>The subject is often represented by the subject pronouns <em>I, you,
he, she, it, we, they</em>, but in reality any noun can be a
subject.</p>
<p>The auxiliary verb (also known as a helping verb) is the part of the
conjugated verb that coordinates between the subject and the principal
verb. Because it has this function, the auxiliary verb is usually the
part that has to be modified in a conjugation, as we will see in the
next section. It is important to realize that there is a limited number
of auxiliary verbs. Auxiliary verbs are a closed category, which means
you cannot simple create a new one.</p>
<figure id="fig:auxiliaries">

<figcaption>he auxiliary verbs</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Each of these auxiliary verbs is involved in constructing a verb
tense or modality, as is explained in chapter 4. The last part of the
conjugation is the principal verb. This is the part that carries the
meaning of the action: anything and everything from jumping, running and
swimming to reading, thinking and dreaming. Pincipal verbs are an open
category, which means it is possible to create new ones if the need
arises. In recent years we have see the acceptance of the verbs <em>to
vape, to dm, to ratio, to troll, to google</em>, for example. Despite
the openness of the category, principal verbs are constrained in terms
of the forms they can adopt. Every principal verb has four basic
forms.</p>
<figure id="fig:principal-verb-forms">
<img src="images/principal_verb_forms.png" />
<figcaption>Four forms of principal verbs</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These forms are used in combination with specific auxiliary verbs to
create verb tenses and modalities, as will be discussed in chapter 4. In
brief, we can summarize the role of each of these forms as follows:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><strong>infinitive</strong>: the ’purest’ form of the verb</p>
<p><strong>past simple</strong>: expresses distance into the past and
separation from the present</p>
<p><strong>past participle</strong>: expresses the idea of
completeness</p>
<p><strong>gerund</strong>: expresses the idea of movement, of ongoing
process</p>
</div>
<p>These descriptions will make more sense after chapter 4. In this
chapter the goal is to understand the role each of these parts has in
conjugation.</p>
<h2 id="conjugating-according-to-person-and-number">Conjugating
according to person and number</h2>
<p>Changes determined by person and number are expressed as word
endings, mostly “-s”, that are attached to the auxiliary verb. This can
be seen in the following table, which contains the most basic auxiliary
verbs:</p>
<p>For the verbs below we see that an “-s” ending indicates a 3rd person
singular conjugation. Sometimes the 1st person singular is also
marked.</p>

<p>It is one of the most important things you can do is to memorize
these simple conjugations. A lot depends on them. Not feeling sure about
these few verbs will keep you from conjugating correctly in all kinds of
situations; knowing them well empowers you to say all sorts of
things.</p>
<p>add a table here with conjugations</p>
<p>Many auxiliary verbs, however, display no changes at all according to
person and number:</p>
<figure id="fig:unchanging-auxiliaries">
<img src="images/auxiliaries_no_change.png" style="width:80.0%" />
<figcaption>Unchanging auxiliaries</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These auxiliary verbs are called undeclined because they do not
change according to person and number. Other undeclined auxiliaries are
“should”, “might”, “may”, “had”, “could”, etc. Because of this, it is
fair to say that English verb conjugation is quite simple. As we saw
above, in the present simple (Special case 1), the positive conjugation
contains no auxiliary verb; therefore, it is the principal verb that
changes according to person (3rd person singular).</p>
<h4 id="the-present-simple">The present simple</h4>
<p>focus specifically on it</p>
<h2 id="three-sentence-types">Three sentence types</h2>
<p>English verb conjugations consist of : A subject (S) + an auxiliary
verb (A) + a principal verb (P) In this order, they make a positive or
declarative conjugation, such as “I can dance”. If you insert “not”
between A and P, you create a negative conjugation: “I can not dance”.
To create a question, S and A are inverted: “Can I dance? Positive,
negative and question are the three types of sentence. These basic
formation rules applies to almost every English tense or modality, as
can be seen in the table below.</p>

<figcaption>Standard conjugation pattern by sentence type</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Exactly one auxiliary verb and one principal verb are needed for most
conjugations. Only in specific (advanced) cases do we use more than one
auxiliary verb or more than one principal verb in a conjugation. This
explains why it is a mistake to say: *We not go &gt;&gt; auxiliary
missing *He do not can go &gt;&gt; too many auxilaires (you only need
one) *He do not will go &gt;&gt; too many auxiliaries (you only need
one)</p>
<p>However, not all of the tenses follow the above conjugation pattern
exactly.</p>

<h2 id="pronunciation-of-word-endings">Pronunciation of word endings
</h2>
<p>Present simple 3rd person “-s” endings become “-es” and are
pronounced /iz/ after “-ss”, “-sh”, “-ch”, and “-x”. Examples: • it
breaks, he sweats, she drinks, it burns, he destroys, she sells, etc /s/
• it crashes, he catches, she fixes, he passes /iz/</p>
<p>Past simple endings are normally pronounced /d/, but they must be
pronounced /id/ after “-t” and “-d” • they crashed, we sensed, he
tracked, you smelled, it passed, she banned /d/ • they printed, they
texted, you separated, she invented, we decided, you provided /id/</p>
