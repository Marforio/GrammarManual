<h1 id="logical-connectors">Logical connectors</h1>
<p>Logical connectors are words that help to organize language into
coherent arguments. They communicate the ways in which one idea can lead
into another. In terms of parts of speech, logical connectors are
conjunctions, adverbs or prepositions.</p>
<h2 id="logical-categories">Logical categories</h2>
<p>Connectors can be organized into five logical categories: sequence,
cause and effect, comparison, expansion, and counter-expectation. As
explained below (6.2), connectors that are followed by a noun phrase are
marked , and those that are followed by a subordinate clause are marked
. Sentence modifiers are marked . This is easily the largest group. Most
sentence modifiers are separated from the rest of the sentence by a
comma.</p>

<h4 id="sequence">Sequence</h4>
<p>This is also before-and-after Sequence connectors create a sequential
order.</p>
<p>First, secondly, next, then, after that, finally, in addition,
furthermore, in conclusion, to summarize, to sum up • First (Firstly), /
Second (Secondly), / Third (Thirdly), • Next, remove the toner
cartridge. • Finally, add salt and pepper. • In addition, / Furthermore,
the pump must be descaled regularly. • In conclusion, / To summarize, /
To sum up, this is a great investment opportunity.</p>
<h4 id="cause-and-effect">Cause and effect</h4>
<p>Cause and effect connectors create relations of cause and effect, or
reason and result.</p>
<h5 id="cause">CAUSE</h5>
<p>The concepts of REASON and PURPOSE can be included under CAUSE. These
are the most important CAUSE connectors. because, because of, since, as,
given that, owing to, due to, with the aim of, (in order) to,
considering • Owing to a lack of water, the tanning industry has been
forced to shut down. • The interactive part of the program has been
cancelled due to low audience participation. • Since there is no more
water, the tanning industry has been forced to shut down. • We ask you
to stop watering your plants as there is little water left in the
reservoirs. • The bridge design was modified with the aim of reducing
wind drag.</p>
<h5 id="effect">EFFECT</h5>
<p>The concept of RESULT can be included under EFFECT. These are the
main EFFECT connectors. as a result, therefore, consequently, because of
this, thus, so • The market is changing. As a result, we have decided to
increase our investment in research. • The market is changing.
Therefore, we have decided to increase our investment in research. • The
market is changing. Consequently, we have decided to increase our
investment in research. • The market is changing. We are thus going to
increase our investment in research. (*no comma needed after thus) • We
have had a bad year financially, so we cannot afford to donate more.
(*no comma needed after so)</p>
<h4 id="comparison">Comparison</h4>
<p>Comparison includes logical relationships of similarity or
contrast.</p>
<h5 id="similarity">SIMILARITY</h5>
<p>and, also, too, as well, similarly, in the same way, likewise •
Herons live in the northern United States and in most of Canada too. •
Herons live in the northern United States and in most of Canada as well.
• In the USA, New Yorkers are known for working hard. Similarly,
Londoners are reputed to be among the hardest-working Brits. •
Kentuckians are likewise some of the friendliest people you’ll ever
meet.</p>
<h5 id="contrast">CONTRAST</h5>
<p>but, in contrast, by contrast, on the other hand, alternatively,
while, whereas, unlike • Herons are opportunistic hunters but seagulls
depend almost entirely on sardines. • Herons are opportunistic hunters.
In contrast, seagulls depend almost entirely on sardines. • John studies
hard the night before his exams; Ralph, on the other hand, prefers to do
his preparation earlier. • While Volkswagen has been tremendously
successful, Chevrolet is going through an internal crisis. • Fribourg is
bilingual, whereas Bulle is monolingual. • Unlike my colleagues, I am
going to work hard for the exam.</p>
<h4 id="expansion">Expansion</h4>
<p>There are four ways in which we can expand on an idea.</p>
<h5 id="be-more-specific">BE MORE SPECIFIC</h5>
<p>ADD DETAILS that is, in other words, : (colon), which is to say, In
fact, Actually, As a matter of fact, Concretely, More specifically, In
particular • Bill is a black belt karate fighter, that is, he has
reached the highest level of mastery of his discipline. • Some birds are
perfectly adapted to their environment. In other words, they possess
specific hunting and locomotion strategies to live in local habitats. •
John is a complete fighter, which is to say, he has all of the necessary
skills, experience, physical strength and wisdom. • John is a complete
fighter: he has all of the necessary skills, experience, physical
strength and wisdom.</p>
<h5 id="add-arguments">ADD ARGUMENTS</h5>
<p>this is another way to expand. very similar to creating a sequence
furthermore, in addition, moreover • Cockroaches can withstand high
levels of radiation. Furthermore, they can endure extreme weather
changes. This makes them the ultimate survival machine. • We will lower
taxes to make our state more attractive to multinational companies. In
addition, we will create job programs for the unemployed. • His report
was poorly written and, moreover, it had no real substance. Note:
furthermore and in addition are used when you only add one more reason
or argument to those mentioned before. Moreover is used to add a reason
or argument of a different kind. In practice, it is not always easy to
make this distinction.</p>
<h5 id="exemplify">EXEMPLIFY</h5>
<p>for example, for instance, such as, including • Berlin is a lively
city. This weekend alone, for instance, more than 300 concerts are
taking place. • When fish are not available, seagulls will eat other
things, such as crustaceans, mice and even smaller birds. • This
smartphone has several revolutionary features; including facial
recognition, smart object tracking, and a bezel-less foldable
screen.</p>
<h5 id="generalize">GENERALIZE</h5>
<p>in general, more generally, overall, on the whole • Early primates
were able to transition from forest habitats to the savannah. More
generally, they proved capable of adapting to almost any environment
they encountered for the next 40’000 years.</p>
<h4 id="counter-expectation">Counter-expectation</h4>
<p>or exception These connectors introduce exceptions or unexpected
information (in relation to an earlier statement). This type of logical
relationship is very useful rhetorically, as it creates a feeling of
surprise or unexpectedness. however, on the other hand,
nevertheless/nonetheless, still, although (even though), while, then
there is, yet, and yet, despite (in spite of) a. Unexpected information
or exception after a statement: o Winters in the North Pole can seem
endless. Still, a few creatures manage to thrive here. o These vents at
the bottom of the ocean offer no possibility of survival to aerobic
organisms like fish and mollusks. Anaerobic bacteria, on the other hand,
thrive here like nowhere else. o Although it’s raining, I will go
outside. o In spite of the danger and risks, I will climb this mountain.
o Geneva is a very interesting metropolis. However, the cost of living
there is high. o Geneva is a very interesting metropolis. The cost of
living there is high, however. o The weather will be mostly dry and
sunny, yet we cannot entirely exclude the possibility of summer
thunderstorm. b. Unexpected information or exception before a statement:
o I will go outside despite the rain. o I’ll have to eat something
although I’m not hungry. o This winter has been terribly cold. However,
winters in Spain are usually mild and pleasant.</p>
<p>Note: the connector however shouldn’t be confused with the adverb
meaning “in whatever way”:</p>
<p>• LOGICAL CONNECTOR: I am very hungry. However, I refuse to eat. •
ADVERB meaning “in whatever way” or “it doesn’t matter how”: o However
you look at the situation, there seems to be no solution. o However
grumpy and unfriendly your cat is, you have to keep it and take care of
it. o However much you saved on that computer, in my opinion you wasted
your money.</p>
<h2 id="syntactical-types">Syntactical types</h2>
<p>Now that we have seen the five logical categories, we can focus on a
few rules that govern how connectors are used in a sentence. There are
three main types: connectors followed by a noun phrase, connectors
followed by a subordinate clause, and sentence modifiers. For
convienvience I have labelled these as the blue, green and red groups
respectively.</p>
<h4 id="blue-group-add-a-noun-phrase">Blue group: add a noun phrase</h4>
<p>The following connectors are complemented by a noun phrase. A noun
phrase refers to a single noun plus any dependent words it might have,
such as adjectives, determiners and relative clauses. despite, in spite
of + NOUN PHRASE during because of owing to due to according to thanks
to unlike</p>
<p>Examples: • Our picnic will take place despite the heavy rain • You
called during my lunch hour. • The tournament was cancelled due to the
huge storm that hit the region.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: noun phrases do not contain a subject + conjugated verbs!
Note: after despite / in spite of, it is possible to use a gerund verb
phrase: • I played the entire match despite feeling ill. (the fact that
he felt ill) • In spite of being tired, Harvey will go out tonight. (the
fact that he is tired)</p>
<p>In these cases the gerund verb appears without a subject, is
unconjugated, and behaves like a noun.</p>
<h4 id="green-group-add-a-subordinate-clause">Green group: add a
subordinate clause</h4>
<p>Some connectors introduce a subordinate clause (a clause or sentence,
i.e. subject + predicate, that depends on a main sentence). These
connectors are not separated from the subordinate clause by a comma.
Examples: • Although I am very tired, I will work another hour. • Since
you mention it, let’s talk about the timeline. • I finished up the
housework while you were out shopping.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most often used logical connectors that
introduce a subordinate clause: although, even though, though +
SUBORDINATE CLAUSE while whereas since (reason) as (reason) because</p>
<h4 id="red-group-sentence-adverbs">Red group: sentence adverbs</h4>
<p>These connectors modify an entire clause or sentence without
introducing a subordinate clause. They constitue the largest group. •
Furthermore, I would like to propose an entirely new code of ethics. •
In conclusion, the MacBook Air is the finest laptop ever produced. •
John changed his style in clothes, but he didn’t change his lifestyle
habits, however. Most sentence adverbs are separated from the clause
they modify by a comma. These connectors are similar to comment adverbs,
which make a comment on an entire clause or sentence, and are separated
from the sentence they modify by a comma. Examples of comment adverbs: •
Fortunately, we didn’t lose our investment. • Sadly, that was the last
time I ever saw her. Other sentence adverbs, however, are never or not
always followed by a comma. These include first, second, (etc.), then,
after that, also, too, so, thus, yet. • First you chop the onion, then
you fry it in butter. • I was tired of my old life and felt full of
energy to try something different. Thus I decided to start a new career.
• This is what you wanted, so you shouldn’t complain.</p>
<h4 id="case-study-despite-although-however">Case study: DESPITE,
ALTHOUGH, HOWEVER</h4>
<p>The three ways in which connectors are used in a sentence are
exemplified by “despite”, “although” and “however”. These three
connectors have a similar meaning (counter-expectation, or contrast),
but they are different grammatically, as can be seen in the example
below. • Despite the heavy rain, the match will be played according to
schedule. • Although it is raining heavily, the match will be played
according to schedule. • It is raining heavily. However, the match will
be played according to schedule.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-structure-an-analytical-text">How to structure an
analytical text</h4>
<p>List arguments with examples</p>
<p>Transitions</p>
<p>Weigh both sides</p>
<p>Draw conclusions</p>
<p>plus: - make recommendations - explain condigionts (unless, as long
as, if, if not, provided) (qualify your opinion)</p>
