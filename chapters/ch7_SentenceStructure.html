<h1 id="sentence-structure">Sentence structure</h1>
<h2 id="basic-structure-svo">Basic structure: SVO</h2>
<p>The normal order of a declarative sentence is S V O: S V O = Subject
+ Verb(s) + Object Examples: • I like my job • Our guide can speak
French The most important thing to remember is that V and O (verb and
object) always stick together; we do not usually put other words between
them. This means that any adverbs that modify the verb go after the
direct object. • Say: “I like my job very much” (not *I like very much
my job) • Say: “Our guide spoke French fluently” (not *spoke fluently
French) In other words, you should answer the question “What?” before
you answer the question “How?”</p>
<p>The direct object is often followed by circumstantial information
about time and place. When this happens, time usually goes after place:
• Ben walks to work every morning (not *every morning to work) • Sam has
been in Canada since April (not *since April in Canada) In other words,
you should answer the question “Where?” before “When?” In conclusion,
declarative sentences usually give information in the following order:
What? Where? When? The boy scouts picked mushrooms in the forest this
morning. Subject + Verb + What? +Where? + When? Adverbs that answer the
question How? can be inserted in differnt parts of the sentence, but not
between the verb and its direct object: • The boy scouts picked
mushrooms slowly in the forest. CORRECT • The boy scouts slowly picked
mushrooms in the forest. CORRECT Not *The boy scouts picked slowly
mushrooms in the forest.</p>
<h4 id="sec:transitive-vs-intransitive">Transitive vs intransitive
verbs</h4>
<p>Transitive verbs are verbs that have a direct object. The verb bring,
for example, cannot form a complete thought without an object. In other
words, you have to say what you bring. Intransitive verbs are verbs taht
do not have a direct object. The verb laugh, for example, is used
without an object: I laughed out loud. Often, verbs can be transitive or
intransitive: I sang the anthem (transitive); I sing well
(intransitive)</p>
<p>The reason this matters is to be careful with verb pairs one is
transitive the other intransitive. The verb rise, for example, which
means to go up or to move up, is always intransitive: the sun rises. The
related verb raise, has a similar meaning applied to a direct object: to
move something up, to lift something: The canton raised taxes. It is
sometimes difficult to remember which verb is which. Here are common
pairs</p>
<p>rise raise lie lay speak say fall drop</p>
<h4 id="sec:ditransitive">Ditransitive verbs</h4>
<p>"Verbs that usually require an indirect object before the direct
object are often referred to as **ditransitive verbs**. These verbs
typically take two objects: an indirect object (usually a person) and a
direct object (usually a thing). The indirect object usually comes
before the direct object in the sentence structure.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of ditransitive verbs:</p>
<p>1. **Tell**: - Correct: S̈he told him the story.-̈ Structure: [Subject]
[Verb] [Indirect Object] [Direct Object]</p>
<p>2. **Give**: - Correct: Ḧe gave her a gift.-̈ Structure: [Subject]
[Verb] [Indirect Object] [Direct Object]</p>
<p>3. **Show**: - Correct: T̈hey showed us the way.-̈ Structure: [Subject]
[Verb] [Indirect Object] [Direct Object]</p>
<p>4. **Send**: - Correct: Ï sent them a letter.-̈ Structure: [Subject]
[Verb] [Indirect Object] [Direct Object]</p>
<p>5. **Lend**: - Correct: C̈an you lend me a pen?-̈ Structure: [Subject]
[Verb] [Indirect Object] [Direct Object]</p>
<p>6. **Offer**: - Correct: S̈he offered him a job.-̈ Structure: [Subject]
[Verb] [Indirect Object] [Direct Object]</p>
<p>7. **Teach**: - Correct: Ḧe taught the students a lesson.-̈ Structure:
[Subject] [Verb] [Indirect Object] [Direct Object]</p>
<p>8. **Buy**: - Correct: S̈he bought him a present.-̈ Structure:
[Subject] [Verb] [Indirect Object] [Direct Object]</p>
<p>9. **Pay**: - Correct: Ḧe paid her the money.-̈ Structure: [Subject]
[Verb] [Indirect Object] [Direct Object]</p>
<p>10. **Pass**: - Correct: S̈he passed him the salt.-̈ Structure:
[Subject] [Verb] [Indirect Object] [Direct Object]</p>
<p>These verbs inherently require both an indirect and a direct object
to complete their meaning, and the indirect object typically precedes
the direct object in the sentence structure. Understanding the use of
ditransitive verbs helps in constructing grammatically correct and clear
sentences."</p>
<h4 id="sec:monotransitive">Monotransitive verbs</h4>
<p>A few verbs have similar meanings but are distinguised by their
nature as mono- or ditransitive.</p>
<p>remember vs remind say vs tell</p>
<h4 id="recommendations-vs-commands">Recommendations vs commands</h4>
<p>verbs that are more commonly followed by a that-clause rather than by
an indirect object. These verbs are often referred to as "verbs of
suggestion, recommendation, or reporting." These verbs typically
introduce a subordinate clause that begins with "that."</p>
<p>suggest, recommend, propose</p>
<p>Suggest:</p>
<p>Common: "I suggest that you come see me." Less common: "I suggest you
to come see me." Recommend:</p>
<p>Common: "I recommend that he take the job." Less common: "I recommend
him to take the job." Propose:</p>
<p>Common: "She proposed that we go on a trip." Less common: "She
proposed us to go on a trip."</p>
<p>The verbs insist and demand are also typically followed by a
that-clause.</p>
<p>if you are wondering why there is no -s after "suggest that he speak
to", it is due to the English subjuncutve.</p>
<p>In contrast, some verbs are more commonly followed by an indirect
object and an infinitive rather than a that-clause. These verbs often
express desires, intentions, or commands. Examples include: Want:</p>
<p>Common: "I want you to come see me." Less common: "I want that you
come see me." Ask:</p>
<p>Common: "She asked him to leave." Less common: "She asked that he
leave." Tell:</p>
<p>Common: "He told her to wait." Less common: "He told that she wait."
Expect:</p>
<p>Common: "They expect us to arrive on time." Less common: "They expect
that we arrive on time." Order:</p>
<p>Common: "The officer ordered the soldiers to march." Less common:
"The officer ordered that the soldiers march."</p>
<h2 id="questions-special-cases">Questions: special cases</h2>
<h3 id="prepositions-in-questions-and-relative-clauses">Prepositions in
questions and relative clauses</h3>
<p>In questions, prepositions are usually placed at the end: • What are
you waiting for? (Not For what are you waiting?) • What is the weather
like? (Not Like what is the weather?) • Where do you come from? (Not
From where do you come?) • Who are you thinking of? (Not Of whom are you
thinking?) The same applies to relative clauses (see section 10.3).
Prepositions go at the end of the clause: • This is the man I told you
about. (Not ...the man about whom I told you) • That is the ugly table I
want to get rid of. • This is the vacation we always dreamed of.</p>
<h3 id="indirect-questions">Indirect questions</h3>
<p>As we saw in section 4, the standard question form is: A S P =
Auxiliary verb + Subject + Principal verb An indirect question is a
sentence in which one question is embedded in another. Take these two
questions: a. Do you know? b. Where does Oliver work? If you embed
question b) in question a), the question structure of b) must be turned
back into positive (declarative) form: • Do you know where Oliver works?
Not *Do you know where does Oliver work? Indirect questions are very
useful because it is often more polite to ask for information this way.
Other examples: • Do you know if we can swim here? • Could you tell me
if there is a restaurant nearby? • I am not sure how this happened. • I
do not know if this computer works.</p>
<h3 id="subject-questions">Subject questions</h3>
<p>The standard question structure ( A S P ) requires that the subject
of the sentence be mentioned. This creates a problem when you do not
know the subject of the sentence, that is, when you are asking about the
subject. Consider this case: • X invented Coca Cola. If you want to know
the identity of X, the standard question structure would produce this
result: • *Who did X invent Coca-Cola? This is absurd, considering that
you do not know X. For this reason, when asking questions about the
subject (or “subject questions”), we use a different question structure.
The solution is quite simple: we simply apply the positive (declarative)
form S A P , replacing the subject with an interrogative adverb (Who or
What): Who/What + A P ? • Who can come to the conference? • Who will go
to John’s party? As you know, in the present simple and past simple, the
positive (declarative) form does not contain an auxiliary verb. The
subject question therefore has the form: Who/What + P ? • Who invented
Coca-Cola? • Who called me? • What went wrong? • What happened? The
first word in a subject question is always the interrogative adverb
“Who” or “What”. This is because sentence subjects are almost always
people or things, not places, times or reasons. It is probably
impossible to have a subject question that starts with Where? When? or
Why?</p>
<h2 id="coordination-vs-subordination">Coordination vs
subordination</h2>
<p>In grammar, a conjunction is a word that connects two or more words,
phrases, or clauses together in a sentence. Conjunctions help to link
ideas, show relationships between clauses, and provide cohesion to a
sentence or text.</p>
<p>There are three main types of conjunctions:</p>
<p>1. **Coordinating conjunctions**: These conjunctions connect words,
phrases, or clauses of equal importance. They include: * And (e.g., I
like reading books and watching movies.) * But (e.g., I wanted to go to
the beach, but it was raining.) * Or (e.g., Do you want to go to the
park or the mall?) * So (e.g., I’m tired, so I’m going to bed.) * Yet
(e.g., I’m tired, yet I still need to finish this project.) 2.
**Subordinating conjunctions**: These conjunctions connect a dependent
clause to an independent clause. They include: * Because (e.g., I’m
tired because I didn’t sleep well last night.) * Since (e.g., I’ve been
busy since morning.) * After (e.g., I’ll go for a walk after I finish my
homework.) * Although (e.g., I’m tired, although I had a good sleep.) *
Unless (e.g., I won’t go to the party unless you come with me.) * If
(e.g., I’ll go to the movies if you want to.) * Until (e.g., I’ll wait
until you’re ready.) * While (e.g., I’ll study while you’re watching
TV.) as long as 3. **Correlative conjunctions**: These conjunctions are
used in pairs to connect words or phrases of equal importance. They
include: * Both...and (e.g., I like both reading and writing.) *
Either...or (e.g., Do you want to go to either the park or the mall?) *
Not only...but also (e.g., I not only like reading but also writing.) *
Whether...or (e.g., Do you want to go to the beach whether it’s sunny or
cloudy?)</p>
<p>Conjunctions play a crucial role in forming sentences and expressing
relationships between ideas. They help to create clear and coherent
texts, and they’re an essential part of language!</p>
<h3 id="three-simple-rules-for-good-writing">Three simple rules for good
writing</h3>
<h2 id="sentence-structure-special-cases">Sentence structure: special
cases</h2>
<h3 id="cleft-sentences">Cleft sentences</h3>
<p>Putting a few extra (unnecessary) words at the beginning of a
sentence can have the effect of adding emphasis in a desired way. The
result is what we call a “cleft sentence” (cleft means divided or
split). They are called “cleft” because the extra words create an
embedded clause in the subject of the sentence. Though technically
inefficient, they are actually very useful. There are four main
types:</p>
<h3 id="correlative-sentences">Correlative sentences</h3>
<p>Correlatives are pairs of words that work together to join clauses or
phrases. They apply a form of coordination to two clauses or phrases.
Here are some of the most common correlatives: - Either… or… - Neither…
nor… - Both… and… - Whether… or… - As… as… - Just as… so… - Not only…
(but) also… - The more…. The more… Examples: a) Either you learn how to
do it or you prepare to face the consequences. b) The suggestion is
neither useful for the technical team nor realistic in terms of the
budget. c) This is both the culmination of years of work and the
beginning of a new and exciting phase. d) John said he was not sure
whether to stay home or to leave immediately. e) There are as many
spoons as there are forks. f) The more you try to erase me, the more
that I appear. // The higher they rise, the farther they fall. g) Just
as storks fly south for the summer, so do penguins swim north as
temperatures drop. h) Not only is it beautifully designed, it is also
technologically advanced. i) Not only did they block the road, they also
cut the power lines.</p>
<p>As illustrated in these examples, three rules for correlatives are:
a) Symmetry. Make the structure of the two phrases as parallel as
possible; don’t use gerund in one phrase and infinitive and the other,
or present simple in one phrase and a modal verb in the other. Example:
- Even at night, she can usually be found in her office either listening
to student problems or she works working on her research. b) Clarity.
Repeat prepositions or articles as needed to make the parallel structure
as clear as possible. Example: - Robinson sent copies of his speech not
only to his senators and representatives but also to his friends and
family.</p>
<p>c) Commas. As a general rule, correlative conjunctions do not require
the use of commas. However, to coordinate two main clauses (subject +
predicate), the comma might be useful or even necessary, as in examples
g, h, and i above. In these three examples we see also a peculiar
inversion of subject and auxiliary verbs (“so do penguins swim”; “not
only is it beautifully designed”; “not only did they block the road”).
Inversion for emphasis was the subject of the previous section in this
chapter.</p>
<h3 id="inversion-for-emphasis">Inversion for emphasis</h3>
<p>Look at these sentences: 1. My brother is selfish and he’s also very
lazy. 2. I sat down and my phone rang again. 3. I have rarely met a more
irritating person. 4. I always vote Republican. Actually, I am a
registered party member. 5. We only realized at that moment what a huge
mistake we had made. These factual sentences could potentially express
emotions or opinions more dramatically. What is missing? The answer is
that the structure of these sentences is too ordinary and predictable
for the emotional peak they could potentially express. In formal
English, especially in writing, we sometimes change the normal word
order of a sentence to make it sound more emphatic or dramatic. For this
we use certain adverbial expressions followed by an inverted clause
(inversion of subject and auxiliary verb). Here are the most common
adverbs followed by inverted clauses: • Not only… • Only then… • Never…
• Rarely… • Hardly… when… / Scarcely… when… • No sooner… than… • Not
until… • Only when…</p>
<p>Now here are the same five sentences rewritten in a more emphatic
manner: 1. Not only is my brother selfish, (but) he’s also very lazy.
(Is my brother selfish?) 2. Hardly had I sat down when my phone rang
again. (Had I sat down?) 3. Rarely have I met a more irritating person.
(Have I met?) 4. Not only do I always vote Republican, I am actually a
registered party member. (Do I vote?) 5. Only then did we realize what a
huge mistake we had made. (Did we realize?) Simply put, we use a
question structure after the adverb to add emphasis to the sentence.
Notice what happens in the case of the present simple (sentence 4) and
past simple (sentence 5): to create the inversion or question structure,
you have to insert the auxiliary verb “do /does / did”, as you would do
in a normal question. Not until… and Only when… are followed first by
the temporal circumstance, then by the inverted or question structure.
Examples: • Not until we had driven far away from there did we feel safe
again. • Only when we were given the trophy did we realize what we had
achieved.</p>
