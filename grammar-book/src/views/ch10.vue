<h1 id="prepositions">Prepositions</h1>
<h2 id="movement">Movement</h2>
<p>With verbs that denote movement, use the preposition <span
class="smallcaps">to</span>:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>I often go to the market</em></p>
<p><em>Last summer I went to India</em></p>
<p><em>I will fly to Spain next year</em></p>
<p><em>We were driving to the stadium</em></p>
<p><em>I ran all the way to Tafers</em></p>
</div>
<p>Notice the difference between <em>I travelled to India</em>, which
means ’I made the trip from Switzerland to India’, and <em>I travelled
in India</em>, which means ’I moved around in India’.</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Home</span> is a special case. The word <span
class="smallcaps">home</span> as a destination is used without a
preposition. We say <em>go home; come home</em>, not .</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>
<p>You should memorize the following rules:</p>
<h5 id="at">AT</h5>
<p>We use <span class="smallcaps">at</span> with ’night’ and the hours
of the clock:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>I love to read at night</em></p>
<p><em>I have a meeting at 12 o’clock</em></p>
</div>
<h5 id="on">ON</h5>
<p>We use <span class="smallcaps">on</span> with days of the week and
dates:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>I was born on May 12th, 1976</em></p>
<p><em>The course takes place on Thursdays</em></p>
</div>
<h5 id="in">IN</h5>
<p>We use <span class="smallcaps">in</span> with ’the morning’, ’the
afternoon’, and longer periods (months, seasons, years, decades,
centuries):</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>I have a meeting in the afternoon</em></p>
<p><em>I have a week off in July</em></p>
<p><em>I like picking mushrooms in Autumn</em></p>
<p><em>I was born in 1999; He lived in the 1960s</em></p>
<p><em>The Roman empire expanded in the 2nd century BC</em></p>
</div>
<h5 id="by">BY</h5>
<p>We use <span class="smallcaps">by</span> with deadlines: <em>Please
finish this activity by 5 pm tomorrow.</em> In this example, <span
class="smallcaps">by</span> has a meaning similar to <span
class="smallcaps">before</span>.<br />
refers to the incorrect choice of time preposition.</p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of an action refers to its objective, intention, aim or
reason for being. English offers two basic options for expressions of
purpose:</p>
<div class="compactenum">
<p><em>I bought a car to drive to work</em></p>
<p><em>Supercars are made for driving in a racetrack</em></p>
</div>
<p><span class="smallcaps">to + infinitive</span> is used in most cases,
especially when then aim or objective is specific: <em>I came here to
fight with the Fremen</em> (this is the specific objective). We use
<span class="smallcaps">for + gerund</span> when describing the function
of a tool or object in general: <em>These machines are for training
only</em>.</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember is that the combination of <span
class="smallcaps">for</span> + infinitive is not allowed in English. It
is a very common error, especially among Italian speakers, to say or
.</p>
<h2 id="future-clauses">Future clauses</h2>
<p>A few prepositions introduce a subordinate clause, that is, a subject
+ verb, to provide information about time or other conditions.</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p>when I return</p>
<p>after I arrived</p>
<p>before you call</p>
<p>as soon as you return</p>
<p>in case we miss the flight</p>
<p>until I succeed</p>
</div>
<p>These subordinate clauses remain in the present tense even when the
main clause is in a future tense. Examples:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>I will call you as soon as I have the chance</em> not</p>
<p><em>We will keep trying until we succeed</em> not</p>
<p><em>Please inform us when the transaction is complete</em> not</p>
</div>
<p>refers to the incorrect use of future tense in a time clause.</p>
<h2 id="collocations">Collocations</h2>
<p>Many verbs and adjectives are complemented by a specific preposition.
These word combinations are called collocations. Some important
collocations to remember are:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p>depend on: <em>I depend on my parents for financial support.</em></p>
<p>look at: <em>Look at that bird. It’s so beautiful!</em></p>
<p>interested in: <em>I’m very interested in rock art.</em></p>
<p>participate in: <em>I will not participate in the event.</em></p>
<p>good / bad / great / terrible at: <em>I must admit, I’m terrible at
telling jokes.</em></p>
<p>responsible for: “<em>George is responsible for international
sales.</em></p>
<p>similar to: <em>The new Opera House is similar to the MOMA
building.</em></p>
<p>different from / different to: <em>This is different from anything
I’ve seen before.</em></p>
<p>protect from: <em>Shutters protect windows from wind and
rain.</em></p>
</div>
<p>refers to an incorrect collocation, that is the incorrect combination
of a verb or adjective with a preposition.</p>
<p>The most frequent collocation errors are probably , , and .</p>
