<h1 id="pronouns">Pronouns</h1>
<p>The function of a pronoun is to replace a noun or noun phrase. A
group of individuals speaking can be replaced by <em>We</em>; a woman
can be referenced as <em>she</em> and an object can be referred to as
<em>it</em>. This form can change depending on whether the pronoun is
the subject of the sentence or an object, or whether it replaces a
possessive phrase.</p>

<h2 id="table-of-pronouns">Table of pronouns</h2>
<p>This table of pronouns might seem like a lot of information, but it
is actually much simpler than the equivalent tables in French and
German. The subject and object pronouns are easy to memorize and their
use is straightforward.</p>
<p>refers to incorrect choice of a subject or object pronoun resulting
from insufficient memorization or practice. refers to the incorrect
inclusion of an apostrophe or single quote in the possessive adjective
<span class="smallcaps">its</span>. It is incorrect, for example, to
write <em>The house façade lost color</em>. The fact that <span
class="smallcaps">its</span> is a possessive adjective does not entail
the use of possessive ’s (discussed in chapter 12).</p>
<p>Other errors involve conceptual differences between English on the
one hand and French, German or Italian on the other. They are dicussed
in the following sections.</p>
<h2 id="no-gender-for-objects">No gender for objects</h2>
<p>Unlike other European languages, English does not apply a gender
(masculine or feminine) to objects such as cars, houses, trees and
everything else. We always use <span class="smallcaps">it</span> to
refer to such objects. It is a common error to use a masculine or
feminine pronoun to refer to a thing.</p>
<h2 id="possessive-adjectives-and-pronouns">Possessive adjectives and
pronouns</h2>
<p>The possessive pronouns are <span class="smallcaps">mine, yours, his,
hers, ours, and theirs</span>. These pronouns replace a possessive noun
phrase such as <em>John’s car</em> or <em>the company’s budget</em>.</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">my, your, his, her, its, our and your</span>
are technically not pronouns. They are actually possessive adjectives,
because they modify the noun rather than replace it: <em>my car, your
money, his life, her music, our future</em>.</p>
<p>Using possessive pronouns and adjectives can be difficult due to an
important difference between English on the one hand and French and
Italian on the other. This difference involves the third person singular
possessive adjectives and pronouns, i.e. <em>his, her(s) and
its</em>.</p>
<p>In English, the gender of the possessive adjective or pronoun (his,
her(s), its) is determined by the owner, i.e. the possessing agent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John is a man with a computer and a house. His computer is new. His
house is old.<br />
Mary is a woman with a computer and a house. Her computer is old. Her
house is new.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see that the adjective is always <span
class="smallcaps">his</span> when John is the owner, and <span
class="smallcaps">her</span> when Mary is the owner.</p>
<p>French works differently. In French, the gender of the pronoun comes
not from the owner, but from the gender of the object itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jean est un homme. Son ordinateur est nouveau, mais sa maison est
vieille.<br />
Marie est une femme. Son ordinatuer est nouveau, mais sa maison est
nouvelle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, the adjective changes from <em>son</em> to
<em>sa</em> as a function of the gender of the object. The adjective
does not tell us anything about the gender of the owner.</p>
<p>This difference often leads to confusion in the use of possessive
adjectives and pronouns.</p>
<h5 id="a-friend-of-mine">A FRIEND OF MINE</h5>
<p>The expression <span class="smallcaps">A friend of + possessive
pronoun</span> is often used incorrectly. An similar expression exists
in French, but it uses an object pronoun: <em>C’est un ami à moi</em>.
This expression cannot be translated word by word into English.</p>
<p>refers to the incorrect use of an object pronoun with <span
class="smallcaps">A friend of</span>, such as .</p>
<h2 id="reflexive-pronouns">Reflexive pronouns</h2>
<p>Reflexive pronouns are needed when a subject pronoun and an object
pronoun are used in the same sentence in refernce to the same person.
Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I see myself in the mirror. He doesn’t ask himself why he does
what he does.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>results from not using a reflexive pronoun to describe a reflexive
action. Avoid, for example, saying . The cause behind this error is
often simply a lack of practice with reflexive pronouns.</p>
<h3 id="reflexive-vs-non-reflexive-verbs">Reflexive vs non-reflexive
verbs</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, some verbs are reflexive in French or German but not
in English. One such case is <em>remember</em>. Notice how the English
translation differs from French and German in not being reflexive:</p>
<div class="center">
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;"><strong>English</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: center;"><strong>French</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: center;"><strong>German</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">I remember it</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">je m’en souviens</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Ich erinnere mich daran</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">I feel good</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">je me sens bien</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Ich fühle mich gut</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>It is therefore an error to add the pronoun <em>myself</em> or even
<em>me</em> after remember in the following way: .</p>
<p>English uses reflexive pronouns less often than French because it has
other ways of giving verbs a reflexive meaning. One of these is the verb
<span class="smallcaps">get</span>, as shown below.</p>
<div class="center">
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;"><strong>English</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: center;"><strong>French</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: center;"><strong>German</strong></th>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">get married</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">se marier</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">sich heiraten</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">get dressed</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">s’habiller</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">sich anziehen</td>

</tbody>

</div>
<p>Reflexivity can also be suggested by a preposition: <em>se maquiller
= put on makeup</em>.</p>
<h2 id="relative-pronouns">Relative pronouns</h2>
<p>There is actually an additional set of pronouns not mentioned in
figure <a href="#fig:pronouns" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:pronouns">1.1</a>.</p>
<p>The relative pronouns <span class="smallcaps">who, which, that and
whose</span> have the job of replacing an already-mentioned noun at the
beginning of a new clause that gives further information. Relative
pronouns help us avoid repetitions of this sort:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Michael is a determined character. Michael doesn’t take no for an
answer.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of repeating <em>Michael</em>, we can connect both sentences
using a relative pronoun.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Michael is a determined character who doesn’t take no for an
answer.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this second example, <span class="smallcaps">who</span> is the
relative pronoun replacing <em>Michael</em> and heading the relative
clause <em>who doesn’t take no for an answer</em>.</p>
<p>Relative clauses provide further information about a person or thing
already identified in the main clause.</p>
<p>English grammar has simple rules for the use of relative
pronouns.</p>
<h5 id="that">THAT</h5>
<p><span class="smallcaps">That</span> is the most flexible of the
relative pronouns. You can use <span class="smallcaps">that</span> to
refer to both people and objects, and even with times:</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p>refer to people: <em>One man that revolutionized marketing was Steve
Jobs.</em></p>
<p>refer to things: <em>Many frog species only live on trees that are
only found in this part of the jungle.</em></p>
<p>with <em>the day, the year, the time</em>: <em>1983 was the year that
they got married; The bungee jump was the only time that I feared for my
life.</em></p>
</div>
<h5 id="who">WHO</h5>
<p>This relative pronoun is used exclusively with persons or with
personified entities such as teams or companies.</p>
<div class="compactitem">
<p><em>The teacher who helped me had never been kind to me
before.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Be careful not to mistake English <span class="smallcaps">who</span>
for French <em>où</em>.</p>
<h5 id="which">WHICH</h5>
<p>We use <span class="smallcaps">which</span> exclusively to refer to
things: <em>This is an insult which I will not soon forget</em>. In this
example, ’which’ can and often is replaced by ’that’, with no difference
in meaning. However, the use of which is obligatory when the clause is
non-defining, as in this example: <em>"Cattle-related emmissions, which
is the second biggest source of air pollution, is rarely
discussed."</em></p>
<h5 id="whose">WHOSE</h5>
<p>Whose replaces a possessive adjective such as <em>her</em> or
<em>his</em>: <em>She is the engineer whose research I told you
about.</em> (<em>whose</em> replaces ’her’ research).</p>
<p>refers to the inability to use the relative pronoun <span
class="smallcaps">whose</span> correctly.</p>
